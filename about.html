<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    My name is Justin and I love games and I love programming. My favorite game of all time is Maplestory and it is why I created the
    projects on this website in the first place. If you didn't know, Maplestory is a 2D mmo rpg released in the mid 2000s.

<h1>About the Website</h1>
<p>
    It started with the node solver when my friend complained about having to tediously check combinations of 
    random resources in game. If you have never played the game you can think of this problem as a modified set cover problem
    where each subset is exactly of size 3 and you are trying to cover the original set exactly 2 times.
    I spent a few hours and created a python script that would do the job but you had to input everything through text which was tedious.
    I wanted to share the program with more people so I turned it into a website and I translated the python code into javascript and you can find it here: <a href="../NodeSolver/NodeSolver.html">Text Node Solver(Old)</a>.
    I thought it was good enough at the time and moved on to a simple guide that I still maintain I like to call the <a href="../reference/NodeGuide.html">Node Guide</a>.    
</p>

    After a while I thought that the old Node Solver was tedious to input and the user experience was very poor. One way that the user
    experience could be improved would be if you could take screen shots of the nodes in game, instead of typing out each node 1 by 1.
    This idea would play around in my mind for months until I figured out how to do it. I used some of my knowledge from my computer vision 
    class to analyze screen shots and extract the relevant information. I used mean squared error to compare pixels to identify similar pixels and
    classified nodes according to what they are most likely to be. In the end I was successfully able to create a system that could identify nodes in game 
    and give a correct list of them. This information can be fed into the old node solver code to get back the data needed in a fraction of the time
    it took to use the old node solver. I am proud of this project because it has not only helped me but also the people I interact with in game to make
    the game more enjoyable for them too. If you're curious about this project you can see it <a href="../imageSolver/imageSolver.html">here</a> along with a demo
    I made using an early UI.
