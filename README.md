# NodeSolver
web app for maplestory
We all have that scenario where we open up 200 nodes, look through our boost nodes and we see about 20-30 usable trios but we need to work through
all the combinations to see what is optimal. This web app is just for that situation. Just type in all your trios, type in what you're going for 
and press calculate. You will get an answer in miliseconds.
